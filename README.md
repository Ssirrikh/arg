# Project ARG

The __**Aegis Reclamation Group**__ welcomes you to **LenOS**, the latest in modular augmented reality environments! We at ARG have committed to ensuring LenOS remains free to users of all supported Interface devices.

However, ARG would like to reiterate that __***this is not a game***__, and all users should strive to use LenOS safely and responsibly. Any interactions with the **sub-layer terminal** or other non-ARG-published augmented reality sublayers are undertaken at the user's own risk.

Futuri Gratia. For our future, and the future of all who come after.
